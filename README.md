Instead of switching between multiple navigation apps for different purposes, we offer a convenient one-stop solution to access all types of navigation services to save time and effort. Introducing: **_Roadio_**, an all-encompassing mobility platform developed for [Vitesco](https://www.vitesco-technologies.com/en-us)'s Work Smarter & Sustainable challenge.

## ‚ùì What it does
- Our app offers seamless transitions between driving directions, walking routes, public transit information, cycling paths, and more.
- Users can access real-time traffic updates, estimated time of arrival, alternative routes, and public transportation schedules to choose the best path based on their preferences.
- Roadio provides **personalized features** tailored to individual preferences where users can save personalized addresses, collect sustainability points, and rank up the leaderboard.
- Users can **carpool** using a fellow co-worker's vehicle on their way to the office or offer a ride and earn sustainability points.

## üíª How we built it
- Technologies: `Docker`, `Streamlit`, `React`, `Figma`, and of course, `StackOverflow`
- Datasets: `Vitesco`'s sample dataset, `OpenStreetMap`'s API, and `World CO2 emissions` dataset
- Languages: `Python`, `JavaScript`, `HTML/CSS`
